Hey y'all!

This is my attempt to do #100DaysOfCode, with a new interesting language, Rust Language! *yaaay*

### For those who don't know:
#100DaysOfCode is a kind of challange that started by [@Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code). There is an official website (sort of) in http://www.100daysofcode.com/

The rules are simple:
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

Since the purpose for doing this is for learning, and it's a bit different from the originals, let's change the #1 rule a little bit:
1. Learn something via coding every day for the next 100 days.

Yup, that's good.
Anyways, let's track my progress here:
